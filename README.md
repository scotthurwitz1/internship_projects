Unit_test.js: This highlights the unit tests implemented to address code quality concerns identified through SonarQube analysis. These tests serve to validate recent code changes, prevent regression, and ensure the correctness, reliability, and maintainability of the codebase. They cover error cases along with integration points, bolstering the code's robustness. Utilizing frameworks like Mocha and Sinon, these tests can be seamlessly integrated into the CI pipeline, enhancing the development process by catching issues early. By focusing on resolving code smells, bugs, and security vulnerabilities, this effort contributes to an improved codebase. Proprietary data has been changed or redacted. 

Cloudwatch_Query_Lambda.py: This AWS CloudWatch Query Lambda function was crafted to query log times within an AWS native application, subsequently triggering SNS notifications upon detecting performance degradation. The Lambda function utilizes the Boto3 Framework to execute log queries in CloudWatch Logs, compares log timestamps against predefined thresholds for performance assessment, and initiates SNS notifications when degradation is identified. Deployment entails creating an IAM role for the Lambda, defining CloudWatch queries and thresholds, setting up an SNS topic, and configuring invocation, while ongoing monitoring ensures prompt awareness and maintenance of the application's performance. By seamlessly integrating AWS services, this solution contributes to robust performance management and timely response to potential issues.
